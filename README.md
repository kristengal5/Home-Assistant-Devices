I created this game in my Advanced Web Design class as a senior. I chose to create a website about Home Assistant Devices and the privacy concerns they present. This is a responsive website that I coded after writing a research paper about the topic. After the research stage, I created wireframes using Adobe XD, edited photos using Adobe Photoshop, created graphics using Adobe Illustrator, and coded in Sublime Text using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
